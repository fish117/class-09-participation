1.Construct the decision rule according to this classification boundary. How would you classify a new observation that has $x_1=6$ and $x_2=10$?

Because the classification boundary line is :x1-7.8=0
Our observation is x1=6 6-7.8<0 therefore, it should be classified as A (less than 0). 

2.What size is the margin here?
The classification boundary line is :x1-7.8=0
The margin boundary line is :x1-5.8=0  x1-9.8=0 
Therefore, the margin is their distance = 2

3.Which observations receive a penalty? Which observations are the support vectors?
Observations 6,7,8,9 ,10 will receive penalty and they are support vectors.
(No difference between penalty and SV.)
4.What is the total penalty here?
Penalty for 6 and 7 is 0.25.
Penalty for 8 is 1.25
Penalty for 9 is 1.75.
Penalty for 10 is 2.25.
Total penalty:5.75


5.Can I choose a bigger margin if my total allowable penalty is 6?

Yes,because now the total penalty is 5.75 which is less than the allowable 6. We can expand the margin a little bit.


6.Are the data separable? If so, what are the support vectors?
Yes. It might be 4,8 and 9.
